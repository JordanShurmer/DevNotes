Devs the New Author (dialog story telling)
--------------------------------------------------
The dialog is a powerful way we, as developers,Â have to communicate directly to the content authors. It should tell a story.

* Nested components, rather than a listing dialog thing. (e.g. each image in a photo gallery shows up as it's own component on the edit page!
	* Inherit from parses?
	* Include a parsys.
* Maven component plugin.

Modern Front End Build Tools in AEM
---------------------------------------------
Slidedeck: http://slides.com/benwestrate/deck/live

###Why?
1. Dev Speed
2. Code Organization
3. Reusability
4. Nodejs (gives you build tools, file system API, etc....)

###In AEM
* Not a great workflow currently. 
* Maven + Node = Awesome
* Maven Front End Plugin
	* Allows us to pull node in to the mvn project
	* The full power of node inside the arm project
		* gulp/grunt/build tools
		* js lint/compile
		* less/sass
	* Not installing nodejs on the computer.
